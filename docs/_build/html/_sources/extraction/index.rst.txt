TMD extraction tool
===================

workflow
--------

1) Prepare an input file (e.g.  input.py)

2) Run the executable jam3d (python script) to make a fit or to run an MC analysis. See jam3d -h
   for more info

3) Use a jupyter notebook to study the results. To open a notebook, use the command 
   :code:`jupyter notebook` from the command line to open the window.
   Once in the window, each block is run by using the combination SHIFT + ENTER while in the block.

Note: for MC runs, there are additional scripts to help to understand intermediate results.
